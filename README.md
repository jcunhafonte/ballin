# Ballin'

A funny arcade game inspired on Impossible Rush.

## Requirements
* node
* yarn or npm

## Installation

When that's done, install the project dependencies. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic dependency management, but `npm install` will suffice.

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Running the Project

After completing the [installation](#installation) step, you're ready to start the project!

```bash
$ yarn start
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app with hot reload at `localhost:8080`|
|`build`            |Builds the application to ./build for production|
|`serve`            |Test the production build locally|
